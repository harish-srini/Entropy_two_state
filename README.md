# Entropy Calculator for a 2-State System

This application is a Python-based entropy calculator specifically designed to demonstrate entropy in a 2-state probability system. It uses the PyQt5 library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Matplotlib for plotting.

## Features

- **Slider for Biasing:** Adjusts the probability of one state in a 2-state system.
- **Probability Distribution Plot:** Displays the current probability distribution of the two states.
- **Entropy Plot:** Shows how entropy changes as a function of the probability of one of the states.
- **Dynamic Font Size:** Font sizes in plots adjust dynamically based on the window size.

## Requirements

- Python 2.7
- PyQt5
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install PyQt5 numpy matplotlib
